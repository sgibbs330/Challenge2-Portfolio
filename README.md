# Portfolio

I created a clean and organized looking portfolio web application that gives information about myself and my projects that I have done thus far. The website reflects my style as a web developer which is very clean, modern, and aesthetically appealing.

- When you click on the top links at the header of the page, each link will take you to its corrisponding section of the website.
- I added an image of myself and changed the boarder radius to make the image round.
- I googled free images and found an appropriate image that fits my style as a web developer to use as my background image of my website.
- I added the lorem element to fill in the "about me" section to show what it will look like when I later add my experience.
- I created a grid for the "work" section to display the different projects that I have done and will do in the future.
- The gridded images are 'faded' looking until the mouse moves over them, showing the image in full clarity.
- I googled free images and and found clean and basic filler images to put into the project grids that I have yet to do. I named those grids "Project 2-5" and added "Project Info" under the title as a placeholder until I can place my own projects there.
- I made an external link to  google for the placeholder files to show that when clicked, the image takes you to an external website.
- For the "runbuddy" grid, I made it larger than the other project grid images and used a screen capture of the "runbuddy" website.
- I named the grid "runbuddy" and gave the info of "HTML/CSS" to show what the web application is about.
- In the "contact me" section, the "email" link will open up a new, blank email, addressed to me. The "LinkedIn" link will open up an external window to my LinkedIn profile, and the "GitHub" link will open up an external window to my GitHub.
